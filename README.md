# Capstone Project: Jisho Genius

When looking up new words, most dictionaries don't give you the opportunity to save and practice them - and flashcard apps don't usually allow you to import words from a dictionary. 

Jisho Genius combines both by providing an SRS flashcard system that you can feed with your own creations - or with any word from jisho.org.
The app is optimised for Japanese language learning and can therefore also display readings for each entry. 

It is a study buddy for retaining all the new words you learn.
