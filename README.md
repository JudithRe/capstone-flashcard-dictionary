## Capstone Project: Jisho Genius

When looking up new words, most dictionaries don't give you the opportunity to save and practice them - and flashcard apps don't usually allow you to import words from a dictionary. 

Jisho Genius combines both by providing an SRS flashcard system that you can feed with your own creations - or with any word from jisho.org.
The app is optimised for Japanese language learning and can therefore also display readings for each entry. 

Once studied, the profile page gives you useful statistics for your learning.

Jisho Genius is a study buddy for retaining all the new words you learn - even without having to write up all the flashcards yourself.
